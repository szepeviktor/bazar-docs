## Generic Overview

Bazar provides a simple and extendable admin UI that comes with a lots of built-in functionality. The UI is built on `Bootstrap`, `Vue` and `Inertia`.

## Customizing the UI

After running the `php artisan bazar:install` command, Bazar will create symlinks for the compiled assets, so you can use admin surface instantly. However as your application grows, you might want to customize or extend the UI and the functionallity.

To do so, run the `php artisan bazar:publish --tag=bazar-assets` command. This will place all the views, JS, CSS and other assets that the project uses. At this point, all you need to do, is to customize what you want and recompile the assets.

Also, you may use the `--packages` option to automatically update your `packages.json` file with the required `devDependencies`, and the `--mix` option, to update your `webpack.mix.js` file with the proper compiling tasks.

> By default the `app.blade.php` uses the `/vendor/bazar/` prefix in the asset URLs.

## Translations

Bazar is fully translatable. It uses [Laravel's JSON translations](https://laravel.com/docs/master/localization#using-translation-strings-as-keys) on both back- and front-end. To translate string, you have to create a new JSON language file in the `resources/lang` directory with the code of the language. For example the Hungarian translation would be named `hu.json`.

```json
{
    "Dashboard": "VezÃ©rlÅ‘pult",
    "Logout": "KijelentkezÃ©s"
}
```

> Note: the front-end will automatically pick up the translated strings and apply them where possible.

## Defining Admins

By default Bazar looks for an array of emails in the `bazar.admins` config. Of course, you can use a completely different approach to define admin users, it's up to you. But let's take a look at the default approach:

```php
// config/bazar.php

'admins' => [
    'admin@example.com',
    'admin_2@example.com',
]
```

> Note, by default different roles are not supported in Bazar (to keep things simple no plans to change this for now). However once you decide to bring it in, you can easily integrate and customize the different layers for the given admins by using policies and overriding view templates.

After the admins are defined, all users that have their email address in the list will have access to the admin UI. This is controlled by the `can:manage-bazar` middleware, which uses the `manage-bazar` gate definition.

If you want to use an admin list based on the `.env` file, you may do the following:

```
// .env
BAZAR_ADMINS=admin@example.com,admin_2@example.com
```

```php
// config/bazar.php

'admins' => explode(',', env('BAZAR_ADMINS', ''))
```

> Please note, the defined admins will recieve admin notifications as well, the credentials are not used only for authorization.

## Customizing The Authorization

As we mentioned before, the authorization process can be customized easily. By default it checks for the authenticated user's emailaddress, however you can easily change its logic:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Gate;

Gate::define('manage-bazar', function ($user) {
    return in_array($user->role, ['editor', 'cashier']);
});
```

> Note, this gate definition is being used to allow/deny the global access to the admin UI. To customize the authorization in details, you may use policies.

### Policies

[Policies](https://laravel.com/docs/master/authorization#creating-policies) provide a centralized place for definig authorization for different actions. By default Bazar does not provide policies for the models, but you may define your own policies. To do so, follow the original documentation and register your own policies to the Bazar models.

When a policy will be registered to the model, Bazar will automatically apply them in the controller actions.

## Routes

Bazar comes with a bunch of routes out of the box. Bazar routes can be registered easily, using the `Bazar::routes()` method.

```php
use Bazar\Bazar;

Bazar::routes(function ($router) {
    //
});
```

All Bazar routes are web routes. They have the `/bazar` URL and the `bazar.` name prefixes. Also, the `web`, `auth`, `can:manage-bazar` middleware are automatically added to each Bazar routes.

## Validation

You may customize the validation rules that Bazar provides out of the box. To do so, you might listen to Bazar's validation events:

```php
use Bazar\Http\Requests\ProductStoreRequest;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Event;

Event::listen('bazar.validating:'.ProductStoreRequest::class, function ($validator) {
    $validator->addRules([
        'slug' => ['required'],
    ]);
});
```
