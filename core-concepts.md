## The Scope and Scale

Bazar is made to be compact and easy to integrate. This means, our goal is to provide a quite simple solution for those who want to build a small to medium size e-commerce system. Keep it in mind when using Bazar, while its quite easy to scale (because of the Laravel foundations), it's not for the next eBay or Amazon.

## Headless

Bazar does not provide a REST API, nor a ready to use webshop application. It behaves as a framework and it provides every tool that helps you to build your own solutions.

If you need a REST API, because you want to build a Vue based store, you can easily do it. If you need a classic webshop application, no worries, you can build it relatively quickly and easily.

We'll provide example code and solutions in the near future, but the Bazar core will never contain more than it's necessary.

## Drop-in

Bazar is a drop-in solution. This means, Bazar behaves as a package and not as an application. It has its own layer, so you can build many different things in the same application next to an installed and running Bazar package.
